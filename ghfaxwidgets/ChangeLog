	* src/ghfwdlgwindow.c: added show and show_all callbacks to avoid
	displaying the abort button when not needed.
	(ghfw_dlg_window_button_box): this function made public.

	* src/ghfwprogress.c: the GhfwProgressWindows's are now GTK
	widgets too, GhfwDlgWindow being its parent class.
	(ghfw_progress_window_destroy): new destroy method to avoid a leak
	with action_string;
