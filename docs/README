GNU HaliFAX (03/20/2001)
-----------
(previously known as "GNU FaXile")


Why
---
This software package will be a complete free client package for HylaFAX.
It is written because the free software world currently lacks a nice graphical
client package. And as more and more people are going to use the GNU system 
(of which GNU/Linux is the most common version, based on the Linux kernel) due
to the current success of GNOME, it seemed to me that such software was needed.

GNU HaliFAX is part of the GNU project. This means that we are engaged
in integrating it with the rest of the GNU system the best we can,
that all of its components and documentation will be free.

Currently two components are being actively written: the Sender
(gfax), the Viewer (ghfaxviewer). Other components are going to be
written eventually such as an administrative frontend, as well as a
gnome applet to watch for incoming faxes and other facilities.

Help needed
-----------
If you have any idea please send them to us so that we can improve GNU
HaliFAX the best we can.
If you speak a language for which there is no translation, please send
one to us.
If you find bugs, security problems, .. and if you are a programmer,
please send us patches.
If you like this project, if you find it useful or if you just think
we are nice guys, please send us money. The word "free" in "free
software" refers to freedom, not price. Money is always appreciated
and can help us a lot in writing nice programs or enhancing others.
Even if we have long hair, don't sleep and are philosophically
engaged, we are humans who need food and drink to keep our body alive
while our souls are flying across the lines of code.

Requisites
----------
- GTK+ 1.2.x
- libtiff 3.4 (minimum version)
- mingw32, Mumit's Khan GCC port to win32 (if you use such a system) although
  Cygnus Solution Cygwin compiler suite *may* work.

Notes (Win32 only)
------------------
- i18n for GTK+/Win32 USED TO require manual creation of a $lang.utf8
  with iconv after which you HAD to execute msgfmt on it. This problem
  has been solved by creating a special makefile (Makefile.win32)
  which will do all that is needed to build a win32 distribution (in
  .tgz format). Texts are "translated" from LF unix line-ending to
  MS-DOgS, CR-LF line-ending, po files are translated to UTF-8.

Whenever you find a bug in GNU HaliFAX, please write the most detailed

text in those messages, no .gz and no core file for example. Text
diffs are ok though.
