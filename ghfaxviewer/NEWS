- anti-black-pixel (pseudo anti-aliasing) to have smoother images;
- the thumbnails have a new look, imitating Evolution left icon bar.

- the Windows icon is built automatically from the .xpm equivalent;
- the GNOME version is using GNOME native icons;
- the GNOME version is using gnome-print;
- the GNOME and Win32 versions are able to recover its last window position and size;

02/12/2001:

- the program has an application icon now, both on Win32 and GNU;
- Win32 has version and copyright information in its executable;
- the bug which causes Win32 printing to consume all your computer
  resources, to crash the computer, to make your screen jump on itself,
  rotate and die... has been identified and worked-around. The culprit is
  this amazingly buggy Win32 API. Use free software !
- a new zooming algorithm has been implemented, taking into account
  the only relevant pixels in a page. Normal fax pages doesn't have
  that much pixels so the result is a lot faster, although things could
  still be optimized.
- a new menubar has been added;
- the menubar is undockable as well as the toolbar in the GTK+ version;
- basic GNOMification but the GTK+-only version is still available.
  Specify "--without-gnome" as command-line parameter when running
  configure, if you are one of those who like to recompile every
  program they find.
- an about box is now available, listing all the people who have
  contributed to the viewer in a way or another.
- an info box, containing informations about the current fax file is
  now available both in the "File->Properties..." menu or in the
  toolbar, for which I have created another nice icon.
- zh_TW.Big5 (Taiwan Chinese) translation added, thanks to Kevin Chen.
- de (German) translation updated, thanks to Till Bubeck.
