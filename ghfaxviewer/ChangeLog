2001-04-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/ps_print.c: added definition of __compar_fn_t for non-glibc
	systems (patch from Dominik Brettnacher)

2001-04-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* docs/README.cvs: README.cvs is now in docs/

	* README.cvs: added an explanation on how to obtain GNU HaliFAX
	from subversions.gnu.org + instructions on how to submit patches;
	added a note about cvs update.

2001-04-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/callbcks.c (widget_close_cb): when leaving from the menu (or
	any widget) we should save the window status too and not rely on
	viewerclose_cb which should be triggered by a delete_event signal.

	* src/setup.c: keys named win_* should be named viewer_def_*
	instead. 

	* configure.in: minimal gnome-print version is 0.28

	* src/ps_print.c (get_printers): removed unused name[];
	(make_default_pr): choose a default printer following the value
	return by getenv ("PRINTER"), makes the first printer in the list
	(which is also the first in /etc/printcap) the default so that
	systems with BSD LPR will have a default printer anyway.
	(get_printers): defname is filled anyway with at least the first
	entry obtained from lpc

2001-04-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/ps_print.c (get_printers): fixed bug which might prevents
	more than one default printer on BSD LPR based systems

2001-04-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/fileopen.c (file_dialog): reflected previous change all
	along the file

	* src/setup.h (locale_setup): removed this declaration as locale
	setup is handled by app_setup

	* src/setup.c: now includes "setup.h"

	* src/setup.h (CAN_SAVE_CONFIG): new macro for platforms that
	have a native configuration system

	* src/setup.c (save_last_directory): fixed the Win32 function to
	save the name of the last directory to key "last_directory"
	instead of "viewer_def_x"

2001-04-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/ps_print.c (get_printers): attempt to make it work with
	"standard" (what's in a name) BSD LPR system.
	(make_printer_menu): default printer is put on top of the list.

	* src/print.h: moved definitions related to ps_print in that file.

2001-04-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/viewer.h (struct _ViewerData): removed file_name as it was
	not used;

	* src/setup.c (gnome_screen_setup): added ability to remind window
	position and size with gconf (GNOME only);
	(load_last_directory): ghfaxviewer will now save and restore the
	last used directory (GNOME only);

	* src/gn_print.c (print_cb): added check for viewer_data->fax_file
	so as to avoid a segfault if no file is currently loaded.
	(prepare_print_master): it seems this dumb gnomeprint library
	needs a default font even when it is not actually needed.

2001-03-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/about.c (about_cb): added credit to Zbigniew Baniewski for
	its Polish translation;

2001-03-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/gn_print.c: new gnome-print backend;

	* src/winprint.c: removed reverse_bits_of. Thanks to our new (the
	newest, I mean)	drawing algorithm, we can avoid this kind of
	manipulation, at least on ix86 arch.

	* src/thumbnails.c (thumb_button): slight imitation of Evolution's
	(and Outlook) left button style;

	* src/gtkutils.c (back_gtkstyle): modified slightly to be able to
	modify more than one style property. The GtkRcStyle is passed as
	the first argument instead of being created.

	* src/thumbnails.c (add_thumbs): cur_image changed to cur_page;
	(add_thumbs): simplified a lot, put a lot of code in thumb_button;

2001-03-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/draw_page.c (draw_page_func): function to call as a hook to
	update the drawing area backpixmap;
	(pixmap_for_page): don't draw the page on the backpixmap anymore,
	just prepare it;
	(prepare_drawing): small func to setup the user_data for the
	TiDrawFunc hook;
	(draw_page): changed accordingly to our new drawing method;
	(draw_page): removed call to gtk_widget_{un,}map

	* src/zoom.c (process_ir_zoom): call commit_draw if needed;
	(process_ir_unzoom): call commit_draw if needed;
	(ti_zoomed_fax_page): initialize zoom_function values
	   (zoom_cancelled, last_drawn_line);
	(ti_set_draw_func): new func to setup the TiDrawFunc hook
	(ti_set_draw_func_user_data): new func to setup the TiDrawFunc
	user data;
	(ti_cancel_zoom): new function to cancel the current zoom
	operation, not currently used;
	(commit_draw): new function to call the TiDrawFunc hook

	* src/draw_page.c: the ints and the floats shall become the gints
	and the gfloats.

	* src/zoom.c (put_pixel_rot_none_zoom): New test code, trying to
	optimize the zooming algorithm by using memcpy and memset.
	(put_pixel_rot_none_zoom): we try memset alone ;-)
	(put_pixel_rot_none_zoom): simplified again by limiting the number
	of variables used.

2001-03-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/thumbnails.c (add_thumbs): Removed tooltip color change
	since it doesn't work anyway.

	* src/zoom.c: separated zoom rotation functions from
	unzoom-related ones. Added reference comments.

	* src/viewer.c (viewer_window_new): cleaned up a lot: instead of
	using gtk_main_iteration, we draw the page_area when the map
	signal is emitted.
	(viewer_window_realize_cb): button_bar renamed to tool_bar;

	* src/gtkutils.c (back_gtkstyle): inserted a new first parameter
	corresponding to the state of the widget to modify;

	* src/viewer.c: put callback functions in callbcks.c (new file),
	menu-creation functions in menu.c (new file) and toolbar-creation
	functions in toolbar.c (new file);
	(destroy_page_area_cb): renamed to page_area_destroy_cb;

	* src/draw_page.c: removed absurd (too small or too big-slow) zoom
	factors

2001-03-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/zoom.c: changed gfloat to gdouble

2001-03-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/zoom.c (process_ir_unzoom): process_ir split in two distinct
	functions. unzoom is when new_page->width < orig_page->width, zoom
	is when it is the other way around.

2001-03-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/tiffimages.c (process_ir): first shot to obtain smooth
	unzoomed images

2001-03-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/setup.c (app_setup): gdk_rgb_init (), mainly for Win32
	though I am not sure normal GNU GTK+ doesn't need it.

2001-03-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/thumbnails.c (add_thumbs): cleaned up a little bit, part of
	this function (the button creation) has been put in thumb_button.
	(thumb_button): create a new background style for selected pixmap.
	They will now be yellowish so that they will be easier to see.

2001-03-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/tiffimages.c (diagnoze_open_error): positivized the
	magic header test

2001-03-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/winprint.c (print_page): Removed progress stuff since we
	don't need it here anymore.

2001-02-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@contre.com>

	* src/ps_print.c (make_output_frame): enlarged the output file
	GtkEntry

2001-02-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

	* src/gtkutils.c (window_set_icon): removed call to
	gdk_window_set_icon_name, since it wasn't used with its right
	behaviour in mind;

2001-02-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

	* src/about.c: new dialog containing the about box of the
	application;

	* src/info.c: new dialog containing informations about the current
	fax;

	* src/gtkutils.c: new file containing useful and repetitive
	GTK+-related functions, mostly to create nice-looking dialog
	windows;

2001-02-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

	* src/viewer.c (toolbar_new): pixmaps are now loaded at runtime
	instead of being included at compile time;
	toolbars and menubars are detachable now, this give the GTK+
	version of the program a look closer to that of the GNOME version.

2001-02-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

	* src/draw_page.c (draw_page): no verification on image zoom
	anymore;

	* src/viewer.c (main): simplified a lot so that code will be
	cleaner, all init code put in setup.c;
	(parse_params): new function, parse cmdline params;
	(fax_viewer_open): new semantic for FaxViewer; will act more like
	an "object" though just one FaxViewer will be available per process.
	(fax_viewer_new): changed; just creates a new FaxViewerm as its
	name tells us;
	(toolbar_button_new): new function to simplify button_bar_new
	(renamed to toolbar_new);

2001-02-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

	* src/tiffimages.h (enum): NONE, LEFT90, RIGHT90 and UPSIDEDOWN
	respectively changed to ROT_NONE, ROT_LEFT90, ROT_RIGHT90 and
	ROT_180

	* src/tiffimages.c: converted types for coherence with glib;
	new zooming algorithm in place, removed old set_pixel and
	get_pixel functions and added orientation-relative functions;
	struct ir removed as we just need a simple pointer now;

2001-01-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

	* src/viewer.c: Cleaned up. GNOME_FRONTEND is not used anymore
	since NEED_GNOMESUPPORT_H seems to mean the same thing.

	* src/setup.c: New file containing the setup functions initially
	in viewer.c
	(locale_setup): New function to clean the initialzation mess.

	* src/tiffimages.c (rounded_width): New function to compute the byte-
	aligned width of a pixel line, which is the real width of each
	line in memory;
	(ti_zoomed_fax_page): adjusted to new zooming algorithm;
	(generate_image): New generic function to generate a
	zoomed/rotated image, following the new algorithm;
	(ti_open_fax_file): we "TIFFClose" the TIFF file if it is not a
	fax file, this frees some memory and a leak of file descriptors.
	(ti_page_new): new generic function to create a standard page
	structure.

2000-11-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

	* src/tiffimages.c
	(setpixelto): using set_bit and clear_bit from Linux, quite faster;
	(getpixel): unrolled the search loop;
	(struct ir): big optimization trip, we are now caching black areas
	so as to zoom faster, reading pages will be slighltly slower though;

2000-10-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, postscript_print.c, progress.c, progress.h, thumbnails.c, viewer.c, windows_print.c:
    - Windows printing can now be aborted too;
    - Thumbnail computing has its progress bar too;
    - updated German translation
    - released version 0.9.8

2000-10-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * postscript_print.c, progress.c:
    - cleanup of postscript_print;
    - making printing cancellable;

2000-10-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, postscript_print.c, progress.c, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - added possibility to abort an action, needs to be finished for printing;

    * progress.c, progress.h:
    - convenience functions added:
      - gfv_progress_set_done: add "done" at the end of the status label;
      - gfv_progress_update_with_value replaces gfv_print_progress_update
        with a more generic approach;
      - same thing for gfv_progress_update_with_percentage and
        gfv_image_progress_update;

2000-10-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, postscript_print.c, progress.c, progress.h, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h, windows_print.c:
    - added progress bars when computing images (progress.[ch])
    - added related callback function in tiffimages.c
    - added progress bars when printing (needs refining)

2000-10-16  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * tiffimages.c:
    - a bothering problem which occured with the Windows version, causing
      a segfault was that accept(file, "R_OK") was 0 even if we couldn't
      read the file. Maybe it's a bug in Samba, maybe it's a bug in
      Windows...

2000-10-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, errors.c, errors.h, postscript_print.c, print.c, print.h, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h, windows_print.c:
    - print.c has been removed, giving place to postscript_print.c and
      windows_print.c. This, to spare some compile time on my old machine;
    - every non-public function has been declared static;
    - a stupid bug which made the file error dialog box popping up has
      been fixed. The variable viewer.c:main:failures is now initialized
      to FALSE...
    - another bug, which caused a segfault when opening a file through
      the file selection dialog is also fixed. The fail_reason_list was
      missing from the declaration in error.h. In main, that was ok, but
      not file_dlg_ok_cb, where a random value was passed to
      error_bad_files instead.

2000-10-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * errors.c, errors.h:
    - error handling is now complete:
      - the reason why a file couldn't be opened is displayed
        precisely now;
      - "portable" routines have been written, that is, they
        may be used coherently in the whole code, or even in
        other projects;

    * i18n.h:
    - internationalisation macros were moved from viewer.h to i18n.h, so that
      tiffimages.c can use them while being kept independent from the rest of
      the program;

    * cursors.c, cursors.h, draw_page.c, print.c, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - cursors are now set correctly. Although this was not visible on
      the GNU platform, it was on the Win32 platform;
    - patches have been submitted to Tor Lillqvist to make GDK for Windows
      display mouse cursors correctly;
    - a segfault happening when using corrupted TIFF files has been fixed;
    - code cleanup in tiffimages.c, we have now 5 separated routines
      to obtain a rotated/zoomed image, depending on the requested rotation;
    - a bug with the Win32 i18n code has been fixed;

2000-10-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * tiffimages.c, viewer.c:
    - initialized is_fax to 0. So that testing if a tiff file is in fax mode
      returns the correct answer.

2000-09-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - optimizations in the algorithms of function ti_zoomed_fax_page,
      at least, where they could be achieved. Barely visible;
    - added German translation (credit goes to tom@glx.teuto.de);
    - added clockwise and counter-clockwise 90° rotations;
    - released version 0.9.6;

2000-09-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * viewer.c:
    - the windows are of reasonable size on screens larger than 800x600;
    - release 0.9.5;

    * draw_page.c, print.c, print.h, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - struct _FaxImage renamed to struct _FaxPage;
    - functions in tiffimages.[ch] renamed to follow GTK+/GDK/GLib
      naming convention;
    - SEGFAULT happening when closing a viewerwin is fixed (viewer.c,
      tiffimages.c).;
      We now g_strdup on g_basename so that the name of a file
      selected from the GtkFileSelDlg is still available when the
      dialog is destroyed;

2000-09-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * tiffimages.c:
    - fixed a stupid memory leak in tiffimages.c
    - released version 0.9.4

    * print.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c:
    - printing should be a bit faster now since we are using the bit
      reversion table from libtiff instead of computing each value
      each time;
    - Win32 printing does work;
    - we now display the version number in the title bar;
    - a few usual bug fixes;

2000-09-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * viewer.c:
    - small bug fix related to the scroll hand: when the page is
      scrolled to its left and/or bottom side and the hand leaves
      on the right and/or the top of the viewing area, the adjs
      are adapted correctly.

2000-09-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * print.c: *** empty log message ***

    * print.c: - fixed warning generators;
    - added stuff to build Debian GNU/Linux packages;

2000-09-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * print.c, print.h, thumbnails.c, viewer.c:
    - printing to an existing file can now be done;
    - screen size is now correctly handled, 800x600A is no longer the reference
    - fixed a bug which cause gfaxviewer to hang when selecting an invalid file
      in the file selection box;

2000-09-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * thumbnails.c, viewer.c:
    - removed the GtkTable and replaced it with the GtkFixed, too bad...
    - released version 0.9.2

2000-09-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * viewer.c: - small fixes

    * draw_page.c, viewer.c:
    - completed Win32 i18n;
    - fixed a typo in $(topdir)/Makefile.am which made "make distclean" to fail;
    - added better handling of command-line passed filenames;
    - added an error dialog box;
    - fixed a minor bug related to i18n;
    - fixed a bug which prevented the page to be refreshed on some display;
    - fixed a bug in $(topdir)/configure.in which prevented tiffio.h to be detected
      on some systems;
    - released version 0.9.1;
    - wrote README and NEWS;

2000-09-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * cursors.c, cursors.h, draw_page.c, print.c, print.h, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - Copyright is mine, not yet assigned to the FSF
    - Implemented and completed UNIX Printing !
    - Release 1 is close now...

2000-08-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, Makefile, print.c, print.h, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - started implementation of Win32 printing
    - finished new icons; some might need some further work though;
    - some bug fixes;

2000-08-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h, draw_page.c, print.c:
    - new feature added which permit to reverse faxes which were sent in the wrong
      direction
    - (re)wrote new buttons with The GIMP for zoom and reverse buttons. A bit
      NeXTish.

2000-08-16  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * Makefile, print.c, viewer.c:
    - added some basic postscript printing capability (print.c)

2000-08-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, thumbnails.c, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - moving page with the little hand now works
    - clean up some code; the routine used to draw the page area is now the same
      that's used to draw the thumbnails
    - we use now gdk_window_set_back_pixmap; display can't be faster

2000-08-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * draw_page.c, thumbnails.c, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - all wrapper variables are now replaced with their viewer_data->sth
      equivalent, which makes the code cleaner
    - the page image is now centered all the time, thanks to a GtkTable;
      this also fixes the flickering problem which occured on the Win32
      platform
    - the thumbnail area has now a nice looking background; maybe I will add
      another to the page area
    - now I will focus on printing (Win32, gnome-print, personnal)

2000-08-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * cursors.c, thumbnails.c, viewer.c:
    - We don't need stdlib.h anymore since we are using g_malloc and g_free

    * cursors.c, cursors.h, draw_page.c, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, viewer.c, viewer.h:
    - added the GNU General Public License at the beginning of each .[ch] file

    * draw_page.c, thumbnails.c, viewer.c:
    - fixed some bugs.
    - removed some temporary variables who were mapped easily to their
      ViewerData->something equivalent. Code is prettier this way.

    * draw_page.c, gtkfrontend.c, thumbnails.c, tiffimages.c, viewer.c, viewer.h, Makefile:
    - cleaned up some code
    - got rid of all static variables; now the viewer can be used to display
      more than one file at a time

2000-08-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * gtkfrontend.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h:
    - corrected zooming feature; it now checks for pixels in the whole projection
      of the pixel in the original image. In other words, zoomed images don't lose
      any pixel when displayed now;
    - added nice thumbnails button on the left of the page area;

2000-08-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * gtkfrontend.c, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h:
    Added support for image resizing in tiffimages.c
    Added support for (de)zooming in gtkfrontend.c
    Make scrollbar (dis)appear automatically (gtkfrontend.c)

2000-07-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * cursors.c, cursors.h, gtkfrontend.c, Makefile, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h:
    - added cursors.c cursors.h from eog
    - removed a gdkpixmap
    - now we use gdk_bitmap_create_from_data to avoid creating a GdkImage
    - prepare to switch to GdkPixbuf

2000-07-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * gtkfrontend.c:
    - bitmap is not used as the clipping area of the gtkpixmap anymore. Instead we
      use the hack recommended by H. Pennington: create 2 gdkpixmap, paint one
      in black, the other in white, set the bitmap as the clip_mask for the
      black one and paint the resulting pixmap onto the white pixmap.
      the time to load an image is now a bit longer, but refresh time is now
      a lot shorter.
    - cleaned up memory usage: deallocate gc and bit/pixmaps when not needed
      anymore

2000-07-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * faxexpand.c, faxexpand.h, faxinit.c, faxinput.c, gtkfrontend.c, Makefile, tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h, utilities.c:
    - We finally use libtiff. Hence our removal of the old viewfax files.

2000-07-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * tiffimages.c, tiffimages.h:
    - beginning the work with libtiff library because we intend
      to replace the unsuited routines from the viewfax utility
      with it.

2000-07-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wolfgang@ultim.net>

    * utilities.c, gtkfrontend.c, Makefile:
    - setup things so that the bitmaps are used as masks
