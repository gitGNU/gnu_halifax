Before version 1.0 (2001/05/06):

- add better handling of paper size in both Win32 and UNIX versions;
- add paper selection for common types of paper format,
  the viewer currently assumes that the output format is
  the same as the input file;
- add support for plain G3 format and Winfax format; (->independent image library)
- integration with libghfl (the GNU HaliFAX Library for transport);

CONTINUOUS - checking for memleaks and bugs;

D - implement Win32 printing;
D - implement usage of gnome-print;
D - "gnomification";
D - printing to an existing file needs to be reported;
D - add checks for tiff files:
D      - check for file magic;
D      - check for coherence between images infos and actual image data;
D - add error dialogs;
D - add progress dialogs;
D - make dialogs rely on the DialogWindow pseudo-widget (gtkutils.c)
D - all the relevant buttons and menus should be enabled/disabled when
    it is visually logical to do so (file opened/closed)
D - fix problems and conflicts due to different BSD lpr versions and
    behaviours (what a standard)
D - LPSTAT_COMMAND and LPC_COMMAND are dirty static macros that should be
    replaced with dynamic functions to handle the printing system.
